# Home Assistant custom component - iKamand

</span>

Since the event where Kamado Joe stopped supporting his iKamand service... I tried to find a solution to give a second life to this module and avoid the dump!

**iKamand** is based on similar projects and the work of many people. During installation, all components are created in accordance with the iKamand!

## What you need
